# c) If fuel_level is above 5000 AND engine_temperature is at or below 2500, print "Fuel level above 25%. Engines good."

# d) If fuel_level is at or below 5000 OR engine_temperature is above 2500, print "Check fuel level. Engines running hot."

# 6) a) Create the variable command_override, and set it to be true or false. If command_override is false, then the shuttle should only launch if the fuel and engine check are OK. If command_override is true, then the shuttle will launch regardless of the fuel and engine status.
